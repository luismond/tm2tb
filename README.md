# Main features
- Use your own bilingual files in .tmx, .mqxliff, .mxliff or .csv format to extract a bilingual term base in a few seconds.
- Leverage your translation memories to create terminology repositories, which can be used to customize machine translation systems.
- Find translation pairs of single terms, multi-word nouns, short phrases and collocations, which you can reuse conveniently.

# File formats supported:

# Adding more languages:

# Language detection:

- The app uses [langdetect](https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/) to detect the file's languages automatically

# Tests

In the tests folder you can find bilingual translation files in many languages, which you can use to test the app's functionality
